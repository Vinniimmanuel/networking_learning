sniffing network:

 1. Non Promiscous Mode   NIC(Network Interface Card)
 2. Promiscous Mode

Switch is better than Hub, As it sends signals only to specific device

When device first connects to SWITCH it registers "MAC ADDRESS  and Port number" of computer device 
Routing through a specific port number and registered MAC address doesn't mean they provide security
it only meant for it's speed. But there are still some devices that can make SWITCH  work like HUB.

Switch fails to work cause every switch ports have very little amount of memory overwriting this
memory with fake MAC address helps to exploit
